> Thus you may understand that love alone is the true seed of every merit in you, and of all acts for which you must atone.

This was always one of my favorite pics, because what would be the meaning of life without happy goofiness.

It's crazy that Monday I believe will be 2 years since we had our very first interaction when you messaged Casa Roca over facebook.

I wonder what life was like before I met you, I really don't think I remember.

# I wonder if you have ever known how much I've loved you Bri.

I think if you really knew that then you would know that none of it was easy -at all-, that my own heart breaks every day and the pieces are so small that they may never be able to be put completely back together. Wherever you go you take part of my heart with you, there's no way to give it back.

> It is now yours forever.

If none of this makes sense to you it's mostly because I'm crazy, but in part it may be because you've never asked yourself why, why would I break my own heart, why would I risk being incomplete, why be a quitter, why. And yes, I know what I've done as well, and the ginormous mistakes I made, and how I wish I could redo a few things. I really wish I could. And how I've said it before -- I'm so sorry Bri --

> My whole heart says sorry

Your silence has killed me, everyday I wanted to call you, everyday I 
wanted to walk by your office. But I didn't, because I'm so scared to 
see that you don't want to see me, I am so scared that if I look at you,
you won't look at me back, and I'll be alone, I'm scared because that 
kills me even more and it breaks my heart all over again. I feel so 
hated and heartbroken, I feel so disliked, and forgotten. But I try to reminisce on our old smiles and I'll smirk, and I remind myself that I want you to be  happy above all.

You truly are the most wonderful person I have ever met in my whole life, you are the brightest light I have seen in this earthly world, you have given me hope when often it seems like the world is hopeless. This world needs your laughter, it needs your goofiness, it needs your love. I have traveled at least 4 continents, dozens of countries, and hundreds of cities. I have met thousands and thousands of people, of all languages, and many cultures. I can tell you that as a fact of life... There is no one like you in this whole world.-Did hear that?- It's a fact. God has given you a light, and it shined in my life for a long time, and it was awesome as you can see in all the pictures.

I will miss you so so so much Briana, I don't think you actually know how much. Everyday I am freaking out thinking about your last Friday not seeing you again. Because even when you made me invisible I was at least lucky enough to take a peek at you. This cannot be real, because I don't want to say goodbye. This is not real.

> I wish I never had to say goodbye.

I hope this all meant something, you have changed my life. And I think you will forever be in my heart, So I hope this means something.

Sometimes I feel that perhaps for you it didn't mean anything anymore, and then I feel so confused (even more) - But I hope it meant something, and I hope it meas something.

Bri, my love for you is beyond anything I can express or write down, and I don't think I will every stop loving you. I don't know how. But regardless, I hope that it means something to you, because to me it does.

> I Love You Bri.
